# Linux Sysadmin 90-Day Lab (Vagrant + VirtualBox)

A 90-day, hands-on Linux systems administration lab built to practice operational workflows: system bring-up, patching, SSH hardening, monitoring, automation, and incident handling. Work is executed in a controlled local environment using Vagrant and VirtualBox with mixed Ubuntu and Rocky Linux hosts.

---

## Motivation

This repository exists to develop practical Linux administration capability using evidence-driven execution. Each lab activity is documented, verified with captured output, and organized to mirror production operations (runbooks, change records, and incident write-ups).
